# How to contribute
Third-party patches are essential for keeping SEMA great. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
help fix issues and contribute to the core functionality of the SEMA framework. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Custom extensions vs core functionality 
In many cases third party developers will be adding custom extensions to the SEMA framework that are not relevant to the core functionality. 
These extensions should not be 'merged' back to the core. In other cases third party developers may fix defects or extend the core functionality 
and these changes should be submitted via pull requests so that the core is updated


If you are unsure of whether your contribution should be custom, or added to the sema core, please ask.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes to the SEMA-CORE

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Create a pull request that clearly explains the nature of the fix/contribution (Nick can you fill in details)
